I'm a teaching assistant for the course **Linear systems design -- SYST0022-1** at the University of Liège. However, if you're looking for other (probably more relevant) information about this course, you should definitely check the [official course webpage](https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/sacre/SYST0022/) and the [educational commitments page](https://www.programmes.uliege.be/cocoon/20252026/en/cours/SYST0022-1.html)!
