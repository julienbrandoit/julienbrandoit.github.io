Excited to share that our abstract **"Neuronal population inference reveals how neuromodulation reshapes conductance space"** has been accepted for a **poster presentation** at [COSYNE 2026](https://www.cosyne.org/)! 🧠

This work extends our [NeurIPS 2025 workshop presentation](https://julienbrandoit.github.io/posts/neurips2025dbm/) by investigating how neuromodulation reshapes conductance space at the population level. 

**Key idea**: Starting from spike times before and after neuromodulation, our method automatically identifies which ion channel subsets are most likely targeted by neuromodulators -- without requiring voltage-clamp measurements. By embracing degeneracy, we track how entire populations of conductance configurations reorganize under modulatory action rather than isolated parameter changes.

*Population-level inference of ion channel conductances from spike times before and after neuromodulation, with automatic identification of the most plausible conductance targets.*

Out of 1,219 submissions, 705 abstracts (~58%) were accepted for presentation. Looking forward to COSYNE 2026!
