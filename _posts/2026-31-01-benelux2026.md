Excited to share that I will present at the [**45th Benelux Meeting on Systems and Control**](https://www.beneluxmeeting.nl/)! I'm part of two works that will be presented there.

## Work 1: Inferring neuromodulatory targets and conductance parameters from neuronal spike times

This work, which extends our [COSYNE 2026 presentation](https://julienbrandoit.github.io/posts/cosyne2026/), investigates how neuromodulation reshapes conductance space at the population level.

**Key idea**: Starting from spike times before and after neuromodulation, our method automatically identifies which ion channel subsets are most likely targeted by neuromodulators without requiring voltage-clamp measurements. By accounting for degeneracy, we track how entire populations of conductance configurations reorganize under modulatory action rather than isolated parameter changes.

## Work 2: Slow neuronal dynamics from fast activating kinetics in conductance-based models

This work relates to our recent [preprint on pacemaking mechanisms](https://julienbrandoit.github.io/posts/pacemaking/). This work demonstrates that fast-activating gating pore currents are essential for generating slow pacemaking in conductance-based neuronal models, a counterintuitive mechanism validated experimentally.
