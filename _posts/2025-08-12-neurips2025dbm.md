I'm excited to share that I presented a poster at the [Data on the Brain & Mind Workshop](https://data-brain-mind.github.io/) at **NeurIPS 2025** in San Diego, CA! 

## The work

The poster presented our method for reconstructing degenerate populations of conductance-based neuron models directly from spike times using deep learning - the same work from [my first preprint](https://julienbrandoit.github.io/posts/fastdegenerate/) that I shared earlier this year.

**Key idea**: We combine deep learning with Dynamic Input Conductances (DICs) to solve a fundamental inverse problem in neuroscience. Starting from just spike times (the most widely available experimental data), our pipeline:

1. **Maps spike times → DICs** using a lightweight neural network
2. **Generates degenerate populations** via an iterative compensation algorithm
3. **Produces diverse yet functionally equivalent models** within milliseconds

The method handles realistic variability (including Poisson spike trains), works across different neuron types, and comes with [open-source software](https://github.com/julienbrandoit/Spike2Pop---Bridging-Experimental-Neuroscience-and-Computational-Modeling) including a GUI for experimentalists.

## Why it matters

Spike times tell us *what* neurons do, but not *which* combinations of ion channels produce that activity. Our pipeline bridges this gap by:
- Enabling inference from the most accessible experimental data
- Capturing neuronal degeneracy (many solutions → same behavior)  
- Providing interpretable intermediates (DICs) that explain excitability
- Running fast enough for real-time applications

🎓 **Workshop**: [Data on the Brain & Mind at NeurIPS 2025](https://data-brain-mind.github.io/)

The workshop brought together researchers working at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and data analysis. It was fantastic to get feedback and discuss how this approach could be applied to experimental data and extended to network-level inference.

Thanks to everyone who stopped by the poster and to my co-authors Damien Ernst, Guillaume Drion, and Arthur Fyon for their collaboration on this work!
